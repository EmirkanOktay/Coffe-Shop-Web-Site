If your customer wants to contact with you they can use here. I built here with Javascript If your customer uses number in name-surname inputs they'll get a alert like "you cannot use numbers in name-surname" and I made a check function for check the customer's mail if mail doesn't have "@" or ".com" they'll get a alert like "your mail is invalid"

And this is our last stop for main page. Our coffe shop's social media, phone number and mail is here. Also we can go to main page, carrer (I didn't build but If I do that look like main page) and shop page.

You can reach to shop with 3 way :
Navbar
Order
Footer
